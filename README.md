# simplex
A repository of example Simplex implementations in Python (for educational purposes only).

Implementations:
- [Revised Simplex](https://github.com/spartnx/simplex/blob/main/revised_simplex_algo.py) - Python implementation of the Revised Simplex algorithm with Bland's and Dantzig's pivoting rules, as described in Chapter 3 of "Introduction to Linear Optimization" by Bertsemas and Tsitsiklis. The algorithm is tested based on example 3.5 of the 1997 edition of "Introduction to Linear Optimization." Another varying-size test problem is used to validate the algorithm.
